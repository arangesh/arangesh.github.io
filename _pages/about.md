* I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles (LISA)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/), where I oversee the design, calibration and operation of heavily sensorized vehicular testbeds, real-world data collection, and labelling.
* My research interests span Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a focus on object detection and tracking, human activity recognition, driver behavior analysis, and driver safety systems in general. I am also particularly interested in sensor fusion and multi-modal approaches for real time algorithms.
* I received my Master's and PhD in Electrical Engineering at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) where I was advised by [Prof. Mohan M. Trivedi](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=68).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics & Communication Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology, Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/) in India. My undergraduate research advisor was [Prof. Jayasree Chakraborty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6r9hchQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).

# Updates
* *September 2021:* My doctoral dissertation titled [Intelligent Human-in-the-Loop Vehicular Automation with Real-Time Vision Models](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/arangesh/AR_doctoral_dissertation.pdf) was awarded the third prize in the annual [IEEE ITS Best Dissertation Award](https://ieee-itss.org/awards/best-dissertation/).
* *June 2021:* I will be a keynote speaker at the [_Data Driven Intelligent Vehicle Applications_](https://www.in.tum.de/i06/research/ddiva/ddiva21/) workshop at IEEE IV 2021. More details to follow.
* *May 2021:* Our team at LISA has been hard at work with the Amazon ML Solutions Lab to create a unique video dataset to enable the next generation of automotive computer vision models. We plan to provide high-quality video data, fine-grained vehicle and roadway attributes, high accuracy localization and much more!
