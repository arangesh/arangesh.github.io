* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My research advisor is [Prof. Mohan M. Trivedi](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=68).
* As part of the [Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles (LISA)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/), I have been involved at all stages of our operation pipeline. This includes the design, calibration and creation of vehicular testbeds, real-world data collection, processing and labelling, and finally the development and deployment of vehicle and driver safety algorithms.
* My research interests span Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a focus on object detection and tracking, human activity recognition, and driver safety systems in general. I am also particularly interested in sensor fusion and multi-modal approaches for real time algorithms.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics & Communication Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology, Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/) in India. My undergraduate research advisor was [Prof. Jayasree Chakraborty](http://hpbresearch.org/members/jayasree-chakraborty/).
