* I am a Ph.D. candidate at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) with a specialization in Intelligent Systems, Robotics & Control. My research advisor is [Prof. Mohan M. Trivedi](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=68).
* As part of the [Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles (LISA)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/), I have been involved in the design, calibration and operation of heavily sensorized vehicular testbeds, real-world data collection and labelling, and the development and deployment of driver and vehicle safety algorithms.
* My research interests span Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a focus on object detection and tracking, human activity recognition, driver behavior analysis, and driver safety systems in general. I am also particularly interested in sensor fusion and multi-modal approaches for real time algorithms.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics & Communication Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology, Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/) in India. My undergraduate research advisor was [Prof. Jayasree Chakraborty](http://hpbresearch.org/members/jayasree-chakraborty/).
