Reliable prediction of surround vehicle motion is a
critical requirement for path planning for autonomous vehicles.
In this paper we propose a unified framework for surround
vehicle maneuver classification and motion prediction that exploits
multiple cues, namely, the estimated motion of vehicles,
an understanding of typical motion patterns of freeway traffic
and inter-vehicle interaction. We report our results in terms of
maneuver classification accuracy and mean and median absolute
error of predicted trajectories against the ground truth for
real traffic data collected using vehicle mounted sensors on
freeways. An ablative analysis is performed to analyze the relative
importance of each cue for trajectory prediction. Additionally, an
analysis of execution time for the components of the framework
is presented. Finally, we present multiple case studies an
